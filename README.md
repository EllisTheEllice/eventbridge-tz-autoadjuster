# What is the purpose of this project?

See [this blog article]() for details on the background and purpose of this project.

# Prerequisites

## 1. Create a S3 bucket to upload CloudFormation artifacts

CloudFormation requires a S3 bucket for uploading the generated files. This has to be created manually by following [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html). Note down the S3 bucket name, as this will be required during setup.

## 2. Create an IAM role to execute the stack

The deployment scripts use an IAM user with a role assigned to create the infrastructure. So follow [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) to create a new IAM user with a policy. Make sure you add the following permissions to the policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:*",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "events:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Not down the roleÂ´s arn as you will need it in the next step.

## 3. Replace placeholders in deploy_script.ps1

If you are executing the stack from within a Windows environment, you can use the deploy_script.ps1 to do so. There are some placeholders in the file which you have to replace with actual values first:

## 4. Fill config/qa.json with values (optional)

If you want to allow cross-function access to the lambda function, you have to specify the account id in the config/qa.json file.

## 5. Install aws cli

The machine executing the CloudFormation script requires the AWS cli to be installed. Follow [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) to install the cli.

# How to deploy?

If you followed the steps above, all you need to do is to execute the deploy_script.ps1 with Powershell. If you are in a Linux-based environment, you should use the deploy_script.sh instead.
